todo:
  maintain state for login/logout menus/buttons
  maintain tables in admin mode
  now can work on menu based db manipulation, rather than hard coding init
  need to work on page layout via css
  some stuff on front page (what?) or everything behind sign-in?
  do some snmp probing via mibs
  need to build common page elements: inherit as a class, or call a method?
  re-factor the default organization to something else:
    hard-coded, or text-file based, or manually entered
  need mechanism to rebuild/modify tables as schema changes
  .. export and then reload tables .. need to set defaults appropriately
  .. use pgadmin to change tables live?
  automate or match schema changes (inline code vs manual mods needs to be synced)

  drop tables, only if exist, so menu only if tables exist
  add tables, only if don't exist, so menu only if tables don't exist
  need mechanism to diff schema in db vs what is in code

states:
